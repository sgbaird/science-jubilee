Tool Contribution Guidelines
****************************

Overview
========

Most development starts with a GitHub Issue-- see more about issues `here <https://machineagency.github.io/science_jubilee/development/index.html>`_.

If you're adding a new tool, you should follow the same steps outlined in the Code Contribution Guidelines. However, adding tools also requires design files and assembly instructions. This page provides guidelines in this process.

Design Files
------------

In your pull request, please include the design file in addition to fabrication exports. For example, if you design a new tool in SolidWorks, include both the SolidWorks file in addition to an exported `stl`. These files should be added to the `Tool Library <https://github.com/machineagency/science_jubilee/tree/main/tool_library>`_ in subdirectories names ``cads`` and ``stls`` (or something similar). Take a look at the existing tools for reference.

Assembly Instructions
---------------------

In Progress.
