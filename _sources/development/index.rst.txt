Development
===========

Contributions are always encouraged! Contributions include, but are note limited to: finding bugs, fixing bugs, enhancing existing features, adding new tools and features, writing documentation, and participating in discussions. Find information on how to contribute to ``science_jubilee`` here-- and if you have suggestions on how to make the contribution process easier/friendlier/more streamlined, that is also a welcome contribution.

Issues
======

Most discussion around ``science_jubilee`` development is structured around 'issues', or GitHub posts on the `Issues tab of the repository <https://github.com/machineagency/science_jubilee/issues>`_. There are a few issue templates which we have created to organize the conversation, including: bug reports of incorrect functionality, suggestions for new or enhanced features, and discussion posts. Issues should be specific and directly related to the ``science_jubilee`` repository; if you have questions about your own code or would like to share something you've made, please come talk to us on the `Lab Automation Discord <https://discord.gg/Ntx2arK5WS>`_!

To avoid multiple people working on the same thing, we use the issue to discuss a plan of action and decide who will work on the relevant pull request. GitHub allows us to 'assign' issues to particular people. If you would like to work on the issue you raised, please indicate this in your post. If you come across an issue you'd like to work on, leave a comment on the issue so we can assign it to you. This ensures that someone else doesn't also invest time in completing the same issue!
