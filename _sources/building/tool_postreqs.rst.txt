Tool Parking Positions
======================
After you build a tool, you'll need to set the exact location of the tool so it can be picked up.

* There is an overview of the process `here <https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Setting_Tool_Parking_Positions>`_ on the Jubilee Wiki
* We have also created `a Jupyter notebook tutorial <>`_ 


Tool Offsets
============
Tools come in many shapes and sizes. To accommodate tools of different heights and prevent crashes with the bed plate, we need to set a Z offset. To make sure that the tip of each tool is aligned to one another, we also need to set an X-Y offset.

* There is an overview of the process `here <https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Setting_Tool_Offsets>`_ on the Jubilee Wiki
* We have also created `a Jupyter notebook tutorial <>`_ for setting XY offsets.

Duet Configuration
==================
Each tool will need to be configured in software-- see individual tool documentation for more information.
