The Jubilee project has its own documentation and build resources. This page collates existing documentation to help you get started in building a Jubilee.

General Jubilee Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Jubilee Wiki <https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page>`_.  This is the main documentation hub for the Jubilee project. We encourage you to look through the resources organized on the left-hand sidebar--there's a lot of info there! While not all pages on the wiki will be relevant for lab automation, many help demonstrate Jubilee functionality. 
* `Jubilee Discord <https://discord.gg/jubilee>`_. The Jubilee Builders and Extenders Discord is actively used by the Jubilee Community. If you have a question about a build step or troubleshooting your machine, this is a great place to get help! Discussion is organized by topic--you may be interested in the `#lab-automation` channel, for example.

Building your Jubilee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Jubilee Kit <https://www.filastruder.com/collections/jubilee/products/jubilee-motion-platform-kit>`_. The parts to build a Jubilee have been consolidated into a kit which can be bought from Filastruder. (Note: We don't make any money off of this!). 
* `Assembly Instructions <https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Assembly_Instructions>`_. There are assembly instructions for each step of the Jubilee build.
* `Build Videos <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JUbr9aU8eQ>`_. In addition to the pdf instructions, we created a series of videos which guide you through the build process.
