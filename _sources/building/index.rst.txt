To use ``science_jubilee``, you'll need to build both the Jubilee motion platform as well as tools to use on the machine.

        To use a Jubilee for laboratory automation, you first need a Jubilee! This guide collates resources to build the Jubilee motion platform.

        Once you have a motion platform, you can add tools relevant to your application. Exisiting tools for laboratory automation are documented on this page.
